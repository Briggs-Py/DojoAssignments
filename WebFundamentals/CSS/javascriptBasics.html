             <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
             <p>
                 JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely
                 popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximim flexibility for developers
                 to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment
                 (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                 programmatic control over them.

                     <a href=website>Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containersfor
                     storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                     a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
                     These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="var"> var x;</span>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <a href=website>Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables -
                     our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                     <span class="var"> var x = 10;</span>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <a href=website>Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to
                     operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that
                     are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="var"> true</span> or <span class="var"> false;</span>
                     null - <span class="var">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="var">42</span> or
                     <span class="var"> 3.14159;</span> String - <span class="var"> "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                     Array - <span class="var"> [1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object -
                     <span class="var">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <a href=website>Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to preform dirfferent actions for different
                     decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have
                     been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                     conditional statements: <span class="var">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code
                     in our code block; <span class="var">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                     condition is false; <span class="var">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <a href=website>Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
                     but they essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.
                     Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you
                     stop. That's a loop!
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <a href=website>Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function
                     this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imangine we are
                      putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instuction manual and get started, first we screw
                      the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
                      Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
